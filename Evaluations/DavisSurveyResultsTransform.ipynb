       "      <th>16 Q.\\n\\nThe following is the original generated question:\\n\\nQuestion: \\nA protein contains a carboxylic acid functional group with a pKa of 3.5 and an amine functional group with a pKa of 9. What is the most likely protonation state of these functional groups at a pH of 7  and how might this influence the protein's structure and function? \\nOptions:\\nA. Both the carboxylic acid and amine groups will be protonated, making the protein more hydrophobic. \\nB. Both the carboxylic acid and amine groups will be deprotonated, making the protein more hydrophilic. \\nC. The carboxylic acid group will be deprotonated and the amine group will be protonated, potentially leading to electrostatic interactions that stabilize the protein structure. \\nD. The carboxylic acid group will be protonated and the amine group will be deprotonated, potentially causing the protein to unfold due to charge repulsion. \\nCorrect Answer:\\nC. The carboxylic acid group will be deprotonated and the amine group will be protonated, potentially leading to electrostatic interactions that stabilize the protein structure.   \\n\\nExplanation:\\nAt a pH of 7 the carboxylic acid group (pKa 3.5) will be deprotonated because the pH is above its pKa  and the amine group (pKa 9) will be protonated because the pH is below its pKa. This combination can lead to electrostatic interactions that stabilize the protein structure. \\n\\n\\nBelow is the feedback provided on the question\\nIf the students were asked to select the correct answer and the explanation, that could elevate the question to the Bloom's level of \"Analyze\". \\nThe first part of the answers is testing whether or not they understand how pH impacts the protonation state of a functional group given its pKa.  The second part tries to raise the level of the question.  However, it doesn't really work.  Option A is obviously not correct if the student understands the definition of hydrophobic.  Basically, the question could be raised to a higher quality by providing more answers as options and allowing the instructor to eliminate ones that don't work.  (These are two part answers so there are lots of variations.)\" \\nThis question has potential, but the answer options need a lot of work.  Therefore, it would not be an easy question to prep for an exam. \\n\\nDoes the revised form of this question address the feedback provided?</th>\n",

The carboxylic acid group will be protonated and the amine group will be deprotonated, potentially causing the protein to unfold due to charge repulsion. \\nCorrect Answer:\\nC. The carboxylic acid group will be deprotonated and the amine group will be protonated, potentially leading to electrostatic interactions that stabilize the protein structure.   \\n\\nExplanation:\\nAt a pH of 7 the carboxylic acid group (pKa 3.5) will be deprotonated because the pH is above its pKa  and the amine group (pKa 9) will be protonated because the pH is below its pKa. This combination can lead to electrostatic interactions that stabilize the protein structure. \\n\\n\\nBelow is the feedback provided on the question\\nIf the students were asked to select the correct answer and the explanation, that could elevate the question to the Bloom's level of \"Analyze\". \\nThe first part of the answers is testing whether or not they understand how pH impacts the protonation state of a functional group given its pKa.  The second part tries to raise the level of the question.  However, it doesn't really work.  Option A is obviously not correct if the student understands the definition of hydrophobic.  Basically, the question could be raised to a higher quality by providing more answers as options and allowing the instructor to eliminate ones that don't work.  (These are two part answers so there are lots of variations.)\" \\nThis question has potential, but the answer options need a lot of work.  Therefore, it would not be an easy question to prep for an exam. \\n\\nDoes the revised form of this question address the feedback provided?  \\\n",
