# Dissertation Project
This project focuses on generating MCQs using GPT-4o based on sections from a biology textbook. In the evaluations folder, data from surveys is collected, compiled and processed.

The jupyter notebook Evaluations.ipynb within the Evaluations directory analyzes and creates visualizations for the human evaluation and supervised learning evaluations steps. 

The Questions Datasets directory provides excel files for all questions generated during the creation of the project.

The supervised model folder includes a separate directory for creating and training the Bert model and another directory for creating the multiclass machine learning models. The bert.ipynb notebook can be used to train the BERT model and the MultiClass.ipynb notebook can be used to train the multiclass models.
